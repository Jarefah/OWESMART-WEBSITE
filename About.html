    <h1>Our Story: The Beginning</h1>
    <p>
      OweSmart was born from a critical observation: In a world of growing financial complexity, the tools to manage debt were falling behind.
      We saw a generation of ambitious Malaysians—urban millennials and Gen Z—along with the nation's vital Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs),
      struggling under the weight of fragmented financial obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>Need a Debt Strategist? Count on Us.</h2>
    <p>
      We saw the anxiety caused by juggling credit cards, personal loans, and the rise of "invisible" Buy Now, Pay Later debt.
      We saw official data reflecting this reality, with tens of thousands of young Malaysians in significant debt and a high national household debt ratio
      signalling widespread financial vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became clear that the problem wasn't a lack of desire to be debt-free, but the lack of a clear, intelligent, and motivating path to get there.
      Traditional budgeting apps were simple calculators, not strategic partners. OweSmart was created to be that partner.
    </p>

    <h2>Your AI-Powered Financial Ally</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to create a future where every individual and business has a clear, achievable path to financial wellness.
      We envision a place where the burden of debt is replaced by the confidence to pursue long-term goals, secure growth, and achieve lasting peace of mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our brand is built on a core philosophy of empowerment. We are not just a service; we are a coach, a strategist, and a partner on your financial journey.
      Our four key principles guide this philosophy.
